999root's Hacking Library.

Ethical use only.

- DDoS Tools
- Networking Tools
- Normal Programs for Recon

## Warning !!!
This library is souly for educational purposes. I do not condone Black Hat Hacking or any unethical hacking and I advise learners and users to steer away from the path of a black hat. There is really nothing to get out of it other than a bad rep and a criminal record. Use this to learn and understand how hacking can happen and save companies from suffering to bad actors. Thank you.

## How to ethically use this
Create a server with a cloud hosting company and setup webservers, or just any type of server to practice your attack with, Docker containers can be created in seconds.

## Fujin - DDoS Module
Named after the Japanese god of wind, Fujin is a Python DDoS module that I created to help and guide people into creating their own scripts. It contains many functions that can help take down websites, and techniques to avoid and optimise the speed of your attacks. Such as pooling managers, sessions, caching, Async, and custom headers/data. There is documentation in the folder to help guide you use and understand the functions. Best example of Object-Orientated Programming.

## Gargantua
Named after the wormhole, Gargantua is an advanced DDoS from scratch. That utilises techniques used within the Fujin module to create a sophisticated and speedy attack. Caching, session manager, asynchronous functions and threading allow for a speedy attack to take place. Cool ascii art and colours for sensory overloaded users.

## Proxio - Proxy Scraper
With a shitty name comes, Proxio is a python module that assists in scraping proxies for your very own use and contains functions that filters these proxies to store them as multiple data structures and filtering functions to filter by a specfici protocol (socks5, socks4, http, https). This can be useful in MITM, DDoS, etc.

## Hraesvalgr - DDoS with rotating proxies
Named after the fat eagle in god of war game, Hraesvalgr is a DDoS tool using proxies provided to it by the proxio module to send multiple attacks through. These proxies being Socks4, Socks5 proxies measuring up to high speeds, and has the power to take down websites. This is located in the proxio folder and as it was made at nthe same time a proxio.

## Mjolnir - DDoS Script
Named after the Norse god of thunder's hammer, Mjolnir is a simple DDoS tool to help beginners understand a very small scale DDoS attack. This attack can be ran on multiple computers and still cause significant damage. Helps users understand that no matter the size and simplicity of the script it still can cause heavy damage.

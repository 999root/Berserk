## Fujin
Fujin is a Python DDoS module that I created to help and guide people into creating their own scripts. It contains many functions that can help take down websites, and techniques to avoid and optimise the speed of your attacks. Such as pooling managers, sessions, caching, and custom headers/data. There is documentation in the folder to help guide you use and understand the functions.

## Gargantua
Gargantua is a python ddos that scrapes socks5, socks4, http and https proxies and use them to attack websites. It's a simple proxy rotator that can surprisingly attack websites at high speeds. This method of attack makes it extremely difficult for websites to block incoming attackers.
